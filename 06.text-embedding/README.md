## Text Embedding

- An embedding is a numeric representation of data/text.
- Its a vector of floating point numbers.

Why we need it?
> When we are dealing with natural language processing models, you are working with text. They cannot deal with text easily.

Goat and cow are similar words.  
Capital and capitol are not similar. 

> **NOTE**: Vectors that are numerically similar are semantically similar as well

Distance b/w two embeddings measure their relatedness, which translates the relatedness b/w the text concept they represent.  

Embedding applications:
- Semantic search
- Clustering
- Recommendations
- Anamoly detection
- Diversity measurement
- Classification

Building a chatbot for CS, embedding can help the model understand - _I need help with billing_ or _I have payment problem_ are related issues.
